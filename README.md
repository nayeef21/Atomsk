Purpose: 

This repository contains basic Atomsk input files and Windows batch (.bat) scripts to generate atomic structures for molecular dynamics simulations.
The main goal is to simplify structure creation by converting simple text-based Atomsk commands into executable batch scripts. 

The workflow follows three simple steps:
1. Write Atomsk commands in a plain .txt file.
2. Convert the .txt file into a .bat (batch) script.
3. Run the .bat file to automatically generate atomic structures.
4. output/ – Generated atomic structure files (.lmp, .xyz, .cfg, etc.)

Requirements

Atomsk installed and added to system PATH                                                                                                                                                                                        
Windows OS
