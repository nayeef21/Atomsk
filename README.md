Atomsk Structure Generation Scripts for developing atomic structure in different shapes.     
Download Link: https://atomsk.univ-lille.fr/dl.php 
Purpose:
This repository contains basic Atomsk input files and Windows batch (.bat) scripts to generate atomic structures for molecular dynamics simulations.
The main goal is to simplify structure creation by converting simple text-based Atomsk commands into executable batch scripts.
